# Fix Augment

An enhanced unofficial extension for the Augment VSCode extension by Romy Rianata. This extension significantly improves the input and output capabilities of the Augment extension, allowing for larger inputs, better formatted outputs, and a more seamless experience.

## Features

- **Enhanced Input Processing**: Automatically chunks large inputs to make them more digestible for Augment
- **Smart Chunking**: Preserves context and code blocks when splitting large inputs
- **Improved Output Formatting**: Formats Augment's output with better code highlighting and organization
- **Syntax Detection**: Automatically detects and applies the correct language syntax highlighting
- **Multiple Syntax Themes**: Choose from various syntax highlighting themes
- **Auto-Formatting**: Automatically formats Augment outputs as they appear
- **Code Block Optimization**: Special handling for code blocks to maintain their structure
- **API Key Management**: Securely store and manage your Augment API key (for future use - Augment currently doesn't require an API key)
- **Usage Limit Bypass**: Features to help manage and bypass potential future Augment usage limits (Augment currently has unlimited usage)
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor your Augment usage with a convenient status bar counter (for informational purposes)
- **Auto-Reset**: Automatically reset usage counters to avoid potential future limits
- **Highly Customizable**: Configure all aspects of the extension to suit your workflow

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.96.2 or higher
- Augment extension (augment.vscode-augment)
